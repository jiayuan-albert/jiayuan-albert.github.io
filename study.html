      <p class="uiuc-study">I went to University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, IL, USA on August 2021. This is the most
        beautiful campus I have
        ever seen
        in my life!
        I was admitted as Mathematics, but I want to transfer to Math + CS. In the first semester in UIUC, no one knows
        how much bad feelings
        I have in 2021 Fall that semester. I sometimes cry in the evening for my useless not only in study but also in
        interaction
        with people. I missed my home, my family, my friends in China so much! And I don't think I have good friends
        here,
        feeling lonely and hopeless. Finally, after one-semester's hard working, overcoming CS 241 (System Programming)
        and CS 357 (Numerical Analysis) and emtional issues. In the end, I have a GPA of 3.94 and got the chance to
        transfer to Math + CS in LAS.
        And as a reward, my father promised me to buy me my first car!! (More details in Life Section). However, I
        missed the best time to find
        internship from August to December. All right, then just get well with the courses. I selected CS 411 (Database
        System) and that course
        helped me in my programming development, especially for my resume. And now I'm looking for 2023 Summer Software
        Engineering Internship! Let's go ahead and charge forward! </p>
      <p class="xdu-study">
        I went to Xidian University, Xian, China on August 2019 I was admitted as Computer Science after Chinese SAT
        (called Gaokao).
        I had a lot of fun here, accquainted my best friend here. I also joined our university rowing team and attend
        the Champaignship.
        And after two years' of study, I determined to transfer to a university in United States! That thing has never
        ever happened in our
        Xidian University history. And I prepared everything on my own and I succeeded it! I also help other students to
        transfer and learn
        English. I also had a three-month internship with my best friend during winter vacation. I love this university,
        although I cannot
        graduate from here, I cherish my lovely classmates and knowledgable professors. Most importantly, the delicious
        food!!! I also missed
        the cute cat Mimi! QwQ!
